- 👋 Hi, I’m Lukas a sophmore at Montclair State University. I Enjoy coding in my free time and I love learning new things. Currently learning C and revisiting my three hackathon projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself C and data structures and algorithms, but also looking to see what other skills I can learn. I am also taking the Harvard cs50 course right now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I love learning new skills and working on projects.
- 📫 my linkedin is in/lukas-frotton-07b79422b. 
- ☕ I am always looking into new project ideas. I will be attending more hackathons in the future.
