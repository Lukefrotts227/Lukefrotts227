# About Me 
- 👋 Hi, I’m Lukas a sophmore at Montclair State University. I Enjoy coding in my free time and I love learning new things. Currently learning C and revisiting my three hackathon projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself C and data structures and algorithms, but also looking to see what other skills I can learn. I am also taking the Harvard cs50 course right now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I love learning new skills and working on projects.
- 📫 Here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-frotton-07b79422b/) and my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/ljfrotton). 
- ☕ I am always looking into new project ideas. I will be attending more hackathons in the future.
# Learning Repositories 
- Are larger and contain many projects and are setup to showcase my learning overtime.
- These include [Webdevarc](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/webdevarc), [Learning C/C++](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/learningC) and [Learning Data Structures and Algorthims](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/learningDataStructsandAlg).
- However they still contain relavent code and many useful projects.
