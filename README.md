# About Me 
- 👋 Hi, I’m Lukas, a sophomore at Montclair State University who will be transfering to Rutgers New Brunswick in the Spring. I enjoy coding in my free time and love learning new things. Currently learning C and revisiting my five hackathon projects.
- 🏂 Right now, I am building up my portfolio with different projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself C and diving deeper into web development, but also looking to see what other skills I can learn. I am also taking the Harvard cs50 course right now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I love learning new skills and working on projects.
- 📫 Here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-frotton-07b79422b/) and my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/ljfrotton). 
- ☕ I am always looking into new project ideas. I will be attending more hackathons in the future.
- 📁 I deployed my [portfolio website](https://lukasjfrotton.netlify.app) but will continue to update it [here](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/portfolioLukasF). I have to update this with my new projects. 
- 📽️ I am currently working on a project I aim to deploy; check it out [here](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/lukasmanager101).
- 🚄 Working on [this project](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/first-side-project) as well, deployed [here](https://side-project-pioneer.vercel.app/).
- ⏰ Will be redoing hackathon projects in new repo, now starting with [Community Action Organizer](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/CommunityActionOrganizer2.0) and [Climate Collab](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/ClimateCollab2.0).

# Learning Repositories 
- Are larger and contain many projects and are set up to showcase my learning over time.
- These include [Webdevarc](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/webdevarc), [Learning C/C++](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/learningC), [Learning Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/learningDataStructsandAlg), and [Learning Rust](https://github.com/Lukefrotts227/learningrust).
- However, they still contain relevant code and many useful projects.
- With my portfolio site deployed, I will be doing more work in these repositories now.
- I also learn through side projects separate from the repositories.
